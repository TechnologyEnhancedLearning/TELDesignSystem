# TEL Design System
The home of the Technology Enhanced Learning Design System.

## What is the TEL Design System
The TEL Design System provides a set of common components and patterns built on the [NHS Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) for use in TEL and other NHS learning platforms.

The Design System helps us to:
- Build a coherent and consistent interface for our users
- Apply user research at a component and pattern level
- Make sure our interface remains accessible
- Document our approach to interface design
- Share our components with other teams

## Getting started with the TEL Design System
The TEL Design System is provided as a package for use in C# .Net solutions. A compiled version of the CSS and JS is also made available for use in non .Net tech stacks.
